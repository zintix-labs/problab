# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Problab.

At this stage, the project accepts contributions in the following areas only:

- Bug reports
- Documentation improvements
- Typo fixes and clarifications

The following are intentionally out of scope for now:

- New features
- API or behavior changes
- Game logic or math design proposals

This project is currently focused on establishing a stable, production-grade
core and execution model. Broader contribution scopes may be considered in
future releases.

Thank you for your understanding.
